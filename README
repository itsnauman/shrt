                        URL shortener in flask with puns

~ What is Chota?

Chota - meaning short in Urdu - is an awesome url shortener written in Flask as my personal project to dive deeper into flask, it is simple yet powerful. Fork this repo and play around with it, don't forget to make pull requests and make it even better. 

~ Is there a way I can try it out?

Obviously, see the app in action on http://chota-tk.herokuapp.com/ 

~ How can I setup a development enviroment?

 * Clone this repo $ git clone https://github.com/itsnauman/chota.git
 * Install the requirements $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 * Edit __init__.py and provide the path for your local database
 * Run $ python runserver.py to setup an HTTP server at localhost

~ So does it have an API?

Yes, the api is very basic at the moment and needs a lot of improvement but it gets the job done, in order to shorten a url, send a GET request to http://chota-tk.herokuapp.com/api with long url parameter and expect a JSON response in return.

~ How can I contribute?

 * Improve loading speed
 * Write some basic unit-tests

~ What about the license?

Chota is distributed under MIT license, see LICENSE for more details.
